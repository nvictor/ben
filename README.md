# Bit Engineering Notation (BEN)

BEN is a symbolic system for describing the structural logic, cognitive mechanism, and performer status of a comedy bit. It explicitly separates how a joke works from what it is about, enabling diagnosis, iteration, and recomposition.

BEN is designed as a writer's tool, not a taxonomy of joke topics.

## Design Principles

1. **Mechanism over Content**
   BEN encodes the cognitive shift (the "twist") and the structural container, not the topic itself.

2. **Persona-Aware**
   Comedy depends on the speaker's relationship to the audience and the target. Status is first‑class data.

3. **Composable**
   Symbols can be combined to describe complex bits.

## Core Axes

### 1. Form (F)

Structural container or delivery format of the bit.

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `F>` | Linear, setup-punch |
| `F?` | Interrogative, Q&A |
| `F3` | Rule of Three (pattern, pattern, violation) |
| `F~` | Narrative, anecdote |
| `F:` | Comparative, analogy, "X is like Y" |

### 2. Mechanism (M)

The cognitive operation that creates the laugh (the "gap"). Multiple mechanisms may be combined.

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `M≠` | **Reversal:** Broken expectation, irony, value or status flip. |
| `M*` | **Ambiguity:** Multiple valid interpretations: puns, polysemy, double entendre). |
| `M^` | **Exaggeration:** Escalation, hyperbole, absurd amplification. |
| `M_` | **Literalism or Misparse:** Interpreting metaphor, idiom, or abstraction literally. *Defined as a specialized form of reversal.* |
| `M!` | **Recognition:** Sudden pattern recognition or articulation of an unspoken truth. |

### 3. Status (S)

The speaker's relative social or psychological position.

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `S↓` | **Low Status:** Self‑deprecating, victim, confused, powerless. |
| `S↑` | **High Status:** Superior, judgmental, confident, roasting. |
| `S=` | **Neutral:** Reporter, guide, observer. |

## Modifiers (Optional)

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `(C)` | **Callback:** Refers to a previous element. |
| `(T)` | **Topper:** A follow-up punchline to an existing joke. |
| `(A)` | **Act‑out:** Relies on physical or vocal performance. |

## Examples

### Wordplay / Pun

> "I tried a joke about chemistry — it got no reaction."

**BEN:** `F> M* S=`

### Self‑Deprecating Story

> "My father was so cheap that one year for my birthday he only gave me one walkie‑talkie..."

**BEN:** `F~ M^ S↓`

### Rule of Three



## Intended Use

BEN is meant to:
- Diagnose why jokes fail or succeed
- Suggest rewrite paths by swapping symbols
- Teach joke construction without prescribing content
- Support long‑form set and story analysis

BEN does not attempt to encode taste, culture, or audience preference.

*Comedy is not magic. It is structure under pressure.*
